HTML + CSS Activity
Assignment
Using the included mockup.jpg and the content on the last page of this document, recreate the image as a web design:

Write appropriate HTML markup for the provided content.
Add CSS to style the HTML appropriately to create the design in the mockup.
Considerations
The HTML should be well organized and use proper semantics.
You are encouraged to use modern best practices and techniques.
All code should take into account accessibility best practices.
You may add any frameworks or libraries that you want, but none are required.
Consider interactive/hover states of button links.
Optionally, use media queries or other methods to create a responsive layout for smaller screens.
A Photoshop PSD file of the mockup is provided for reference if you find it helpful.
Feel free to use any code editor/development environment that you like, as long as the finished design can be shared online. I recommend https://codepen.io.
